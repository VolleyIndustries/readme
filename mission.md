**Our Mission**

####**Our mission is to help people help each other.** 

Our toughest problems are not usually solved through a traditional search engine but through the help of a person. 

The act of giving and receiving help is what defines community, and in many ways, it’s what makes us human. We’re building delightful, powerful technology that modernizes this fundamental human behaviour for our networked world.

We’re doing this because the internet has not yet realized its potential as a tool for meeting relevant people. Answering *“Who is that crucial person that you need to meet in order to achieve your goal?”* is a vexing challenge that requires a fundamental understanding of both machine and human intelligence. In order to effectively connect people, Volley needs to accurately answer this question from incomplete information. We must then push the boundaries of modeling people's intentions, characteristics, and context through semantic text analysis, psychology, and behaviour driven algorithms. 

Our team believes that it's by operating at the intersection of these that [Volley](http://volley.works) will become the new standard for asking for help online.
