**Our Mission**

####**Our mission is to help people help each other.** 

Our toughtest problems are not usally solved through a traditional search engine but through the help of a person. 

The act of giving and receiving help is what defines community, and in many ways, it’s what makes us human. We’re building delightful, powerful technology that modernizes this fundamental human behaviour for our networked world.

We’re doing this because the internet has not yet realized its potential as a tool for meeting relevant people. Answering *“Who is that crucial person that you need to meet in order to achieve your goal?”* is a vexing challenge that requires a fundemental understanding of both machine and human intelligence. In order to effectively connect people, Volley needs to accurately answer this question from incomplete information. We must then push the boundaries of modeling people's intentions, characteristics, and context through semantic text analysis, psychology, and machine learning. 

It's by operating at the intersection of these that we believe Volley will become the new standard for asking for help online.
