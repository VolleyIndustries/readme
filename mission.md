**Our mission**

####**Our mission is to help people help each other.** 

The act of giving and receiving help is what defines a community, and in many ways, it’s what makes us human. We’re building delightful, powerful technology that modernizes this fundamental human behaviour for our networked world.

We’re doing this because the internet has not yet realized its potential as tool for solving problems that require introductions to people. 

*“Who is that crucial person that you need to meet in order to achieve your goal?”*

In order to effectively connect people, Volley needs to accurately answer this question from incomplete information. We must then push the boundaries of modeling our user's intentions, characteristics, and context. Solving this problem requires deep understanding of human psychology, semantic text analysis, and machine learning. Our team operates at the intersection of machine and human intelligence.
