iOS Challenge
===

Mission:
---
**Create a simple, fast, live search tagging feature for making requests.**

Build a single-view-application that allows the user to pull down on the interface to type into a text field (similar to Ping or Clear) to create a question. As the user types, the application should underline keywords inline by checking an endpoint (see below). 

Constraints:
---
1. Single view application
2. Uses Interface Builder
3. Responsive (iPhone 5 and greater)
4. Front-Fast (30+ FPS)
5. Back-Fast (no noticable delay between keystrokes)

Resources:
---
- Endpoint description (JSON formatted): [<code>GET</code> search/string] (https://github.com/VolleyIndustries/readme/blob/master/development/endpoints/search-string.md)
- The endpoint: [Endpoint with example](https://api.volley.works/search/string?string_query=Wondering%20what%20other%20ios%20developers%20use%20for%20package%20control)
- Use modern, well-montained librairies if needed
- Make use of latest iOS7/8 API's if needed
- Swift or Objective-C, doesn't matter to us (although David feels Swift is more future-friendly and semantically more friendly)

**Good luck!** :eggplant:
