iOS Challenge
===

Mission:
---
**Create an elegant, simple, fast, live search tagging feature for making Volley requests.**

Build a single-view-application that allows the user to pull down on the interface to type into a text field (similar to Ping or Clear) to create a question. As the user types, the application should underline keywords inline by checking an endpoint (see below). 

Design:
---
This part of things is optional, but if you are so inclined, here are some interactions we think are beautiful:

Constraints:
---
1. Single view application
2. Responsive (iPhone 5 and greater, auto-layout a bonus)
3. Front-Fast (30+ FPS)
4. Back-Fast (no noticable delay between keystrokes)

Resources:
---
- Tag search endpoint: [<code>GET</code> /search/string](http://volley-dev.herokuapp.com/search/string?string_query=Wondering%20what%20other%20ios%20developers%20use%20for%20package%20control)
- Use modern, well-maintained librairies if needed
- Make use of latest iOS7/8 API's if needed
- Swift or Objective-C, doesn't matter to us (although Swift is more future-friendly)

**Good luck!** :rocket:
