Frequently Asked Questions

***Why is this on Github?***

Instead of publishing a static website with the standard run of the mill about, contact, FAQ pages, we wanted to give you the ability to contribute. Github makes it easy for you to make changes to this stuff as you see fit. So go ahead and fix a typo, suggest a new [guideline](https://github.com/VolleyIndustries/readme/blob/master/request-guidelines.md), or add a question to this FAQ that you'd like answered.   

***What is volleying?***

Volleying is the act of sharing a person's request with people you think are suited to help. By volleying a request, you are sharing a unique place on the internet where people you trust can help the person in need. You can choose whether to volley a request to a specific friend, or to a million of your followers. It makes no difference to us so long as it helps answer the request. When people you volleyed the request to reply to it, the community is automatically alerted that it was your connection that made that happen. You are rewarded for every view and reply that comes from your volley. 


***Who can see my request when I post it to Volley?***

Requests on Volley are public, and can be seen by both members and non-members alike. 

***What happens when I volley a request?***

When you volley a request to people you think can help, the author of the request is alerted that you tried to help them by connecting them to people you know, but the author is not notified who you volleyed their request to specifically. This is to prevent any uncomfortable pressure on your friends to reply. When your friends do reply to your volley, everyone is then notified that it was your connection that made this happen ☺️

***What will the internet look like 10 years from now?***

We're really opinionated about this. [Let's get into a twitter argument about it](http://twitter.com/volleyworks). 

***What does a good request on Volley look like?***

Requests that get lots of useful replies on Volley accomplish two things: First, they clearly state the skills or experience of the person they're trying to connect with. Second, they explain *why* they’re looking to meet that person. For example, a request like *"I'm looking for feedback from UX designers about how to improve my web app's onboarding experience"* works nicely. For more examples, check out our [guidelines](https://github.com/VolleyIndustries/readme/blob/master/request-guidelines.md). 

<!--***What is Karma?***-->

<!--Karma is a reflection of how much you’ve contributed to the Volley community. Help others to earn more! Creating a request currently costs 10 Karma. Replying earns you 2 and volleying gets you a whopping 5 Karma. -->
