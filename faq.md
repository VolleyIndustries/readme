***What is volleying?***

Volleying is the fun act of forwarding a request to a friend. Volley requests when you know someone who is better suited to help with it. Don't worry: the author of the request won't know who you volleyed it to, so there's no pressure on your friend to reply. 

***Why does Volley require Google sign in and contacts permissions?***

Volley requires Google sign in so that you can easily volley (forward) requests to your gmail contacts and so that you can see requests from familiar faces on Volley. We will never email one of your contacts without your expressed permission. 

***How do I become a member of Volley?***

There are two ways to become a member of Volley. First, you can apply with your email address and clicking 'Join' on [our website](http://volley.works). Second, memberships are also automatically awarded when you help with a request that a current member has volleyed to you.

***Who sees my request when I post it to Volley?***

Creating a request on Volley posts it only to the Volley network. Remember though that members can volley your request to anyone in their addressbook. 

***What happens when I volley a request?***

Volley a request when a friend comes to mind who is better suited to help. It’s a way of quickly saying “Hey, you have the right skills and experience to help his person!” The original requester does not know who you volleyed the request to in order to prevent any uncomfortable pressure for your friend to reply. When you volley a request you earn Karma for helping.

***What will the internet look like 10 years from now?***

We're really opinionated about this. [Let's get into a twitter argument about it](http://twitter.com/volleyworks). 

***What is Karma?***

Karma is a reflection of how much you’ve contributed to the Volley community. Help others to earn more! Creating a request currently costs 10 Karma. Replying earns you 2 and volleying gets you a whopping 5 Karma. 

***What does a good request on Volley look like?***

Requests that get lots of useful replies on Volley accomplish two things: First, they clearly state the skills or experience of the person they're trying to connect with. Second, they explain *why* they’re looking to meet that person. For example, a request like *"I'm looking to chat with UX designers about how to improve my web app's onboarding experience"* works nicely.
