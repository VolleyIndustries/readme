Volley is changing the way people give and receive help from each other. Through careful analysis of the requests and responses on Volley so far, we've created these guidelines to help you create successful requests. 

1. **Focus around a singular need.**
Limit your request to one specific problem. Mention the experience or skills that the ideal person replying to your request has.   
2. **Demonstrate vulnerability.** 
The community is more inclined to help you when you're asking from a position of vulnerability. People want to help those who need help.  

3. **Make the request actionable.**
Be clear about how the community can help you. Tell the community what we can do as repliers to help you solve your problem. Be clear about the commitment youâ€™re looking for (a 5 minute phone call or a quick response?)

4. **Provides context to the problem.**
As much as possible, give context behind the problem the community is helping you solve.  Is this help for your business, for a side project, for a nonprofit you work with? 

The card below is an example of a request that meets all four guidelines. It expresses struggle to solve the problem, clearly states who the ideal replier would be (growth experts), clearly states the commitment required to help (15 min. call), and provides context to the problem (need to build a model for Volley).  This card has a high probablity of receiving many high quality responses.
