Volley is changing the way people give and receive help from each other. Through careful analysis of the requests and responses Volley so far, we've crafted guidelines to help you successfully communicate requests for optimal responses!

Use the following four guidelines as criteria for a high quality request: 

1. **Focus around a singular need.**
To define who you are seeking help from, describe the skills or experienced you are seeking.  What experience or skills would the ideal replier possess?  

2. **Show an expression of vulnerability.** 
The community will be more inclined to help a member asking from a position of vulnerability.  People want to help those who need help.  

3. **Make the request actionable.**
Be clear about how the community can help you. Tell the community what we can do as repliers to help you solve your problem. Be clear about the commitment youâ€™re looking for (a 5 minute phone call or a quick response?)

4. **Provides context to the problem.**
As much as possible, give context behind the problem the community is helping you solve.  Is this help for your business, for a side project, for a nonprofit you work with?
