**Our Mission**
Our mission is to help people help each other.

The act of giving and receiving help is core to our species. It’s what makes us social; in many ways, it’s what makes us human. We’re building delightful, powerful technology that modernizes this core human behaviour for our networked world. 

Now is the time to be working on this mission because today there is tremendous knowledge and valuable connections in your extended network that remain too difficult to access. Volley unlocks the knowledge and connections to help you solve problems that can't be solved by a search engine: problems that require introductions to people.

Creating a platform that empowers people to help each other requires a fundamental understanding of both machine and human intelligence. Our team operates at their intersection, and as Volley grows, eventually the whole world will too.
