##Volley Etiquette 

Volley is a friendly place for helping others. As members of Volley, we agree to: 

ðŸ˜€ **Be helpful and supportive**

Whether you're replying publicly or privately, Volley is a place for being helpful and supportive. If you can't help directly with the author's request, remember that you can always volley their request to someone you know who is better suited to help. If neither you nor anyone you know can help, it's best not to reply. 

ðŸ’¬ **Own our own words**

On Volley, just like on the [internet's first community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL), you own your own words (YOYOW). This means you are responsible for the words that you post. 

ðŸš« **Avoid hiring and selling**

Volley is not a job board, nor is it a place to solicit business. Twisted requests that are really ads in disguise will not be allowed. As a general rule, you shouldn't ask for help on Volley with anything you wouldn't feel comfortable asking a room full of your friends with.
