<h1>We're Back</h1>
<h2>And we've got a lot to talk about</h2>

<p>Firstly, we're excited to show off something we're calling <a href="http://volley.works/radio">Volley Radio</a>! It's a place where people who aren't yet members can get a sense for what kind of questions our amazing members (-->you<--) have! Check it out <a href="http://volley.works/radio">here</a> if you please...</p>

<p>It's hard to believe it's been more than 12 weeks since I've written an update email. For the most part, people really enjoyed getting them, and I always enjoyed writing them. Mike and I wanted to go away for a little while to plan our next move which is why went quiet for a while. It can be difficult and time-consuming to wade through the process of ideas, planning and design, but we feel like after exhaustive effort, we've come up with a great road map.</p>
<p>Ultimately I was sad not to be communicating with all of you as well as we usually do during that process, but we've got a plan for the future we're really excited about and we're well into week two of development on it. We'd love to hear what you think about it (reply to this email with your thoughts)...</p>

<p>So that's it folks, that's what we've been up to. I'll be writing one of these every Tuesday again once we push our new code out and as always I'd love to hear from you if you have anything to say about Volley, life, the birds or the bees.</p>

<h2>Bonus:</h2>
<p>I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP3GNsNWBxA&list=LLbYtDz5EVlOqTUIymtBL0ng&index=33">Henri Texier</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIzTh0Lafg&index=47&list=LLbYtDz5EVlOqTUIymtBL0ng">Baby Huey</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRKNw477onU&list=LLbYtDz5EVlOqTUIymtBL0ng&index=50">Canned Heat</a> while I work this week. I was really inspired by this <a href="http://vimeo.com/83664407">slow motion portrait of people waiting for a subway</a> and if you haven't checked out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/historyporn">r/historyporn yet</a>, you should; it's great.</p>
