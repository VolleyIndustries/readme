<h1>We're Back</h1>
<h2>And we've got a lot to talk about</h2>

<p>It's hard to believe it's been more than 12 weeks since I've written an update email.For the most part, people really enjoyed getting them, and I always enjoyed writing them. Mike and I wanted to go away for a little while to plan our next move and as those things go, they can be difficult and time consuming to wade through. Ultimately I was sad not to be communicating with all of you as well as we usually do and not pushing code gave me srange feels, but we've got a plan for the future we're really excited about and we're well into week 2 of development on it. We'd love to hear what you think about it (reply to this email with your thoughts)...</p>

<h3>Birds Eye View:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We're commited to developing the desktop web version of Volley through 2015 with a team of 4 developers.</li>
<li>We're commited to building an iOS app for Volley which will, *at first*, act as a companion app to the desktop platform.</li>
<li>We're commited to  growing with existing communities (<a href="mailto:david@volley.works?subject=Communities">have any you want to see on Volley?</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>So that's it folks, that's what we've been up to. I'll be writing one of these every Tuesday again once we push our new code out and as always I'd love to hear from you if you have anything to say about Volley, life, the birds or the bees.</p>

<h2>Bonus:</h2>
<p>I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP3GNsNWBxA&list=LLbYtDz5EVlOqTUIymtBL0ng&index=33">Henri Texier</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIzTh0Lafg&index=47&list=LLbYtDz5EVlOqTUIymtBL0ng">Baby Huey</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRKNw477onU&list=LLbYtDz5EVlOqTUIymtBL0ng&index=50">Canned Heat</a> while I work this week. I was really inspired by this <a href="http://vimeo.com/83664407">slow motion portrait of people waiting for a subway</a> and if you haven't checked out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/historyporn">r/historyporn yet</a>, you should, it's great.</p>
