##Improved Volleying
The theme for this week was improving Volleying. With that in mind here's what we changed:

###The good news
* You can now Volley to any valid email address!
* Clicking on a suggested contact now opens the compose menu, not the search menu
* 20 results are shown for every search
* Results are scrollable
* Clicking on a result anywhere loads the compose menu
* Members in your contacts are prioritized
* Inactive members no longer show up in results
* A sign-in button was added on to the `/cards` view
* The `/cards` view now tries to automatically log you in
* Contacts with multiple email addresses are now imported
* Contacts with no name have an inferred name with a cool algorithm I made

###The bad news
* Sign-in on Chrome for iOS is broken because Google. Sorry, we're tracking [the issue](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/issues/189) and will notify everyone when it's resolved
* We're slowing down development after next week to focus our attention on building a brand new release of Volley for the Desktop Web, Mobile Web and iOS that's going to knock your socks off. We want everyone to be a part of its development and will fill everyone in next week on what that means...
