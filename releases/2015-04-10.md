##Improved Front-door and Monitoring
The theme for this week was improving the front door to Volley. Basically, anything you would encounter as a new user or visitor to our little garden. Set your peepers on the list below:

###The good news
- Simplified onboarding to just a welcome card and a bunch more tooltips
- Anyone who recieves a Volley can sign in with their gmail and reply right there (even new users)
- Our team has grown to five!
- If a stranger clicks reply or volley on a card, they can sign up
- Our internal monitoring system for content has been reinforced to bring you better replies and requests
- During creation of a request you can now see a real life succesful example or view our ettiquette guidelines
- People who request an invitation now have the option of subscribing to our product updates
- We're getting an iOS app built

###The not-as-good news
- We spent a good 10 hours on improving Google-related contact/sign-up issues this week, but there are still some people experiencing issues today
- We are slowing development of this version of Volley for the next two months to focus on rebuilding Volley into the product our entire team has spent the last month envisioning
