##Volley Request Guidelines
Follow these guidelines to make it easy for others to help you when you [create a request](volley.works/create) on Volley 

1. ðŸŽ¯ **Focus on a single problem.**
Limit each request to one specific challenge, not two or three. Mention the experience or skills of the ideal person who helps you. 

2. ðŸ’ƒ **Make it actionable.**
Tell the community what we can do to help you solve your problem. Let us know if you're looking for advice, feedback, best practices or a 10-minute phone call. 

3. ðŸŒ² **Provide context.**
As much as possible, explain *why* you're looking for help. We'd love to know what our help is going towards. 

4. ðŸš« **Avoid hiring and selling.**
Volley is not a job board, nor is it a place to promote your business. As a general rule, you shouldn't ask for help on Volley with anything you wouldn't feel comfortable asking a room full of your friends with.

5. ðŸ˜€ **Be genuine.** 
We're on Volley because we want to help real people. Don't be afraid to be yourself.  


ðŸŒŸ*Pro tip: requests that meet these guidelines are much more likely to receive a featured label and be promoted within the community.*
