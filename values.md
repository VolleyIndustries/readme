Our Team is Purpose-Driven 
==
These are our values that manifest both in our team relationship and in our work: 

###Trust
Trust is at the core of our relationship; it's the glue that allows us to communicate and ultimately self-improve. Trust is also what we seek to cultivate with our users, creating a place where they not only trust Volley to do what we say it does, but trust other users they meet through our software to be helpful and kind.  

###Honesty 
Honesty is core to our team communication. Communication is worthless without it. This applies equally to our users, the people who use Volley. No one is going to ask for help on Volley without first trusting the environment and those that are in it.

###Dedication
We recognize that achieving excellence requires relentless dedication, and an understanding that progress is not linear. 

###Swiftness 
We strive to move swiftly in everything we do. We favour learning-through-doing over learning-through-deliberation. Furthermore, we value Volley's user experience being swift both in terms of its responsiveness as well as its intelligence. 

###Delight & Beauty
We're committed to crafting a beautiful, delightful experience that makes both our lives and the lives of our members better. 

###Excellence
We are in the pursuit of excellence. Ultimately this is not possible to achieve without a foundation of trust.
