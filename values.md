Our Team is Purpose-Driven 
==
These are our values that manifest both in our team relationship and in our work: 

###Trust
is at the core of our relationship; it's the glue that allows us to communicate and ultimately self-improve. Trust is also what we seek to cultivate with our users, creating a place where they not only trust Volley to do what we say it does, but trust other users they meet through our software to be helpful and kind.  

###Honesty 
is core to our team communication. Communication is worthless without it. This applies equally to our users: Volley users will never create honest requests without first trusting Volley and its users. 

###Dedication
we recognize that achieving excellence requires relentless dedication, and an understanding that progress is not linear. 

###Swiftness 
we seek to move swiftly (with graceful speed) in everything we do. We favour learning-through-doing over learning-through-deliberation. Furthermore, we value Volley's user experience being swift both in terms of it's responsiveness as well as its intelligence. 

###Delight & Beauty
we're committed to crafting a beautiful, delightful experience that makes both our lives and the lives of  our users better. 

###Excellence
is what we are in pursuit of. It's not possible to achieve without trust and honesty.
