#Team Volley
We’re working on Volley because we believe in the potential of people helping each other over the internet.

####Mike Murchison

Mike's goal is to build an environment around our team that enables everyone to do their best work. One of the things that gets him out of bed in the morning is the realization that only 40% of the world’s population is connected to the internet, and that the remaining 60% will join in the next few decades. The reason he's working on Volley is because he's believes so strongly in the impact of making this place more human and helpful.

####David Hariri

David and Mike started Volley together around this idea that they could build software that helped people help each other. A few months later, Mike spilled red wine all over himself at his wedding. One of the reasons David is so special is because he’s essentially a modern transcendentalist; he’s doesn’t belong to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. He doesn’t even have a phone number. It’s this separation from our digital world which affords him an invaluable perspective and ability to design around the soul of a product.

**Facts:**
- C3PO, Co-Founder
- Previously Teehan+Lax (Developer), Evans & Peck (Consultant)

####Brendan Lynch
<a href="#brendan-lynch"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ja4lCRK.jpg" width="256" alt="our CTO"></a>

Brendan’s worked on some incredible products used by millions of people like Readability and Medium. But what makes Brendan so amazing is not his technical prowess, but his dedication to the idea that the internet can be better used to connect people around problems they’re facing. He’s been working on this idea for 15 years across various products he’s built, all under the name [FindNext](http://brendanlynch.com/text/volley). It was a very exciting day when David and Mike welcomed Brendan to join them as a cofounder of Volley.

**Facts:**
- CTO, Co-Founder
- Previously Teehan+Lax (built Readability, Medium, Krush and others)

####Dan Gauthier

Much like Brendan and David, Dan lives at the intersection of art and code. He actually did a double major in computer science and pop music, which you can see in his work. He’s a tremendous creative force who is leading the development of Volley’s iOS app. Both Dan and Mike think Fantastic Mr. Fox is the greatest movie ever made.

**Facts:**
- iOS 
- Previously iOS @Arroware

####Cory Lee

Cory joined our team recently after graduating from nanotechnology engineering at the University of Waterloo where he cofounded NeverFrost, a YC startup. He’s an incredibly versatile builder, but it’s his ability to distill complex concepts into simple terms where David, Dan, Brendan and Mike find themselves learning the most from him.

**Facts:**
- Web and iOS 
- Previously co-founded @NeverFrost (YC S13)
