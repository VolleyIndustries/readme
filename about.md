### Volley is a friendly place for helping others 

Our mission is to help people help each other, to connect all of the world through the shared, human need for help and understanding.

Use our [website](https://volley.works) to ask for help with something challenging, get advice on that decision youâ€™re unsure about, receive feedback on you project, and learn from others like you and us. *How you use it is up to you*, but to get the most out of Volley you have to pay it forward by replying to the requests of others. 

[We](https://github.com/VolleyIndustries/readme/blob/master/team.md) look forward to helping you on Volley.
